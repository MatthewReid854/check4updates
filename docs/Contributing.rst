Suggestions for improvements and pull requests are most welcome, though I prefer to discuss your suggestion before you go to the trouble of creating a pull request.

If you find a bug or encounter a problem, please raise an `issue <https://github.com/MatthewReid854/check4updates/issues>`_ on GitHub.
