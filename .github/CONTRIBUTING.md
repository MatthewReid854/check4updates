## Submitting new feature requests

You can either open up an issue in the Github Repository with as much context as possible about the feature you would like to see, or email me and we can discuss the idea.

## Submitting code, or other changes

I am happy to receive code snippets or other changes via email. These contributions will be reviewed on an individual basis. I will accept pull requests on GitHub if they do not require significant modification, though my preference is to receive code submissions via email.
